# Graph Theory Playground

Graph Theory Playground is an under-construction tool to enable visualization
of graph theory concepts and algorithms.

Try it at [neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-playground](https://neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-playground/#).
Please be warned that the project is still very much in it's infancy and there
are a lot of things missing and things that do not work.
