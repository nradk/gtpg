# Graph Theory Playground

Graph Theory Playground is an under-construction tool to enable visualization
of graph theory concepts and algorithms.

Try it at [neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-theory-playground](https://neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-theory-playground/#).
Please be warned that the project is still very much in it's infancy and there
are a lot of things missing and things that do not work.

### Implemented Features
- Undirected and directed graph creation
- Multitasking with tabs
- Curved (movable) edges
- Four auto-layout algorithms
- Save and open graph from local device
- Weighted graphs
- Algorithm visualizations:
  - Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:
    - Kruskal'ls Algorithm
    - Prim's Algorithm
  - Search Algorithms:
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search

### Planned Features
- Save and open graph from browser
- Text annotations on graphs
- Editable vertex labels
- Multigraphs
- Better customization of display sizes and colors
- More algorithm visualizations
