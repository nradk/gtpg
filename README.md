# Graph Theory Playground

Graph Theory Playground is an under-construction tool to enable visualization
of graph theory concepts and algorithms.

Try it at [neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-theory-playground](https://neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-theory-playground/#).
Please be warned that the project is still very much in it's infancy and there
are a lot of things missing and things that do not work.

### Implemented Features

- Multitasking with tabs
- Curved (movable) edges
- Four auto-layout algorithms
- Save and open graph from local device
- Weighted graphs
- Editable vertex labels
- Tool-based design with tools to delete objects, add/edit and move objects
- Algorithm visualizations:
  - Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:
